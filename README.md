# css-animation.github.io
This repository serves as a dedicated showcase for a variety of projects built using only CSS for animation and transitions. The goal is to explore the full capabilities of CSS for creating engaging, performant, and accessible user interface effects without relying on JavaScript for movement logic.
Key Features / What You Will Find
Diverse Techniques: Examples utilizing keyframe animations, transform properties (translate, scale, rotate, skew), transition properties, and pseudo-elements.
Performance Focus: Emphasis on using properties that trigger GPU acceleration (like transform and opacity) to ensure smooth, 60fps animations.
Creative Examples: Includes loading spinners, hover effects, parallax scrolling simulations, and complex, multi-step sequences.
Responsive Design: Animations and layouts are designed to look great and perform well across different screen sizes.
Accessibility (A11Y) Minded: Where applicable, includes considerations for users with motion sensitivity, such as leveraging the @media (prefers-reduced-motion) query.
Technologies Used
HTML5
CSS3 (with heavy focus on @keyframes, transition, and transform)
